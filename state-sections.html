    <section id="state-par1">
      Since the 1930's, South Dakota was widely known for its population decline
      due to the Dust Bowl and a combination of economic and climatic
      conditions. However, economic stability returned with the U.S. entry into
      World War II and the implementation of the Pick Sloan Plan in 1944, which
      resulted in the construction of dams providing flood control,
      hydroelectricity, and recreational opportunities.
      <br /><br />
      Now, South Dakota has transitioned from an agriculture-dominated state to
      a more diversified economy, with significant growth in the tourism and
      financial service industries. Nevertheless, South Dakota often ranks
      highly for its quality of life, being named the happiest, healthiest state
      in the United States.
